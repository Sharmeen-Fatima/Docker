# 🔗 Docker Bind Mount / Binding

## 🔹 What is a Bind Mount?

A **Bind Mount** is a way to connect a **folder from your computer** to a **folder inside a Docker container**.

This means:

📁 Your Computer Folder ↔ 📦 Container Folder
Both share the **same files in real time**.

**In simple words:**
A Bind Mount lets a container use files directly from your own system.

---

## 🔹 Why Do We Use Bind Mounts?

Bind mounts are very useful when:

* You are writing code and want to see changes instantly
* You want the container to use files already on your computer
* You are developing websites or apps
* You need to share configuration files

👉 It is mostly used in **development environments**

## 🔹 Real Life Example

### 🏠 Example: Study Table & School Bag

Imagine:

* Your **study table at home** = Your Computer Folder
* Your **school bag** = Docker Container

Instead of copying books every day into your bag, you attach a **zip line** between your table and bag.

Now:

📚 If you put a book on the table → it appears in the bag
📚 If you remove a book from the bag → it disappears from the table

💡 That connection = **Bind Mount**

Both places show the **same files**.

---

## 🔹 How Bind Mount Works

1. You choose a folder on your computer.
2. Docker links (mounts) it into a container folder.
3. The container reads/writes data in that folder.
4. Changes appear on **both sides instantly**.

## 🔹 Example Without Bind Mount

If you copy website files inside a container and then delete the container:

❌ All files are lost

---

## 🔹 Example With Bind Mount

If your website files are in your system folder and mounted into container:

✅ Even if container is deleted
✅ Your files are still safe on your computer

---

## 🔹 Run a Container with Bind Mount

### Syntax:

```bash
docker run -v <your-folder-path>:<container-folder> image-name
```

---

### 🖥 Example (Windows)

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v C:\website:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

Here:

| Part                    | Meaning                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `C:\website`            | Folder on your computer |
| `/usr/share/nginx/html` | Folder inside container |
| `nginx`                 | Web server image        |

Now if you change any file inside `C:\website`, the website updates instantly 🚀

---

### 🐧 Example (Linux / Ubuntu)

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /home/user/website:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

---

## 🔹 When to Use Bind Mount?

✅ Web development
✅ Editing code live
✅ Using config files from your system
✅ Sharing logs to your computer

❌ Not recommended for production databases (Volumes are better)

---

## 🔹 Bind Mount vs Volume

| Feature                     | Bind Mount           | Volume            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Location                    | Your computer folder | Managed by Docker |
| Easy to edit files          | ✅ Yes                | ❌ Harder          |
| Best for                    | Development          | Production data   |
| Safe if system path deleted | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes             |

---

## 🔹 Check Mounts in a Running Container

```bash
docker inspect container_name
```

Look for the `"Mounts"` section.

---

## 🔹 Important Notes

⚠ If you delete files from your computer folder, they will also be deleted inside the container.

⚠ If the folder path is wrong, the container may not work properly.

---

## 🔹 Summary

✔ Bind Mount connects your system folder with a container folder
✔ Changes appear on both sides instantly
✔ Best for development work
✔ Not ideal for important production data

**One-line definition:**

> A Bind Mount links a folder from your computer directly into a Docker container for real-time file sharing.
